# Block Eaters Lottery

A blockchain-based application featuring smart contracts for lottery and voting systems, with an accompanying user interface.

## Overview

This repositoty demonstrates the implementation of decentralized lottery and voting mechanisms using blockchain technology. It consists of smart contracts deployed on a blockchain network and a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Features

- Blockchain-based lottery system
- Decentralized voting mechanism
- User interface for easy interaction with the contracts

## Tech Stack

- Solidity for smart contracts
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- React for the frontend UI
- Hardhat for Ethereum development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
